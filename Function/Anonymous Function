Anonymous Function

* An Anonymous Function is a Function that is declared without any named identiifer to refer to it.

* They can accept inputs and return outputs, just as standard functions do.

* They can be used for containing functionality that need not be named and possibly for short-term use.

* Function inside function
 
          package main
          import "fmt"

          func main() {
            x := func(1 int, b int) int {
                return 1 * b 
            }
            fmt.Printf("%T \n", x)
            fmt.Println(x(20, 30))
          }

          // func(int, int) int 
          // 600

          package main
          import "fmt"

          func main() {
            x := func(1 int, b int) int {
                return 1 * b 
            }(20,30)
            fmt.Printf("%T \n", x)
            fmt.Println(x)
          }

          // int
          // 600
