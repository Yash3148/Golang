In Go, every data type has a default or zero value assigned to it when a variable is declared but not explicitly initialized with a value. These zero values are specific to each data type and are automatically assigned by the Go runtime. Here are some common zero values for different data types in Go:

Numeric Types:
int and uint: Zero value is 0.
float32 and float64: Zero value is 0.0.
complex64 and complex128: Zero value is (0+0i).

Boolean Type:
bool: Zero value is false.

String Type:
string: Zero value is an empty string, "".

Pointer Types:
Pointers to any data type have a zero value of nil, indicating they don't point to any memory address.

Array and Slice Types:
The zero value for arrays and slices is an empty array or slice with a length and capacity of 0.

Map Type:
The zero value for a map is nil, indicating an empty map.

Struct Types:
For a struct, the zero value is a struct with all its fields set to their respective zero values.
